# Dictionary Learning for Clustering on Hyperspectral Images
## Details
Framework for Spectral Clustering on the Sparse Coefficients of Learned Dictionaries. This framework was created as a part of the project I presented for completion of my Computer Science Honours' degree at the University of the Witwatersrand.

## Usage
I have created a pipenv with a lockfile so just download and use   
~~~
pipenv install
~~~
and requirements should be met. Then just run:
~~~
python demonstration.py
~~~
and the demonstration should run. It will train a dictionary and then use it for spectral clustering as discussed in the paper.
